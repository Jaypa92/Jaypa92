Hi, my name is Justin Parris and I am a software engineer from South Carolina. I am very passionate about what I do because not only do I try to take pride in my work, but I actually enjoy doing it. I honed and crafted my skills through the many many hours that I've put daily into Coding Dojo. I've worked on my own but I've also collaborated and worked on many projects with other people and nothing brings me more enjoyment than seeing an idea brought to life whether it be my own or someone else's. In my free time I enjoy learning things, mainly about code but I can usually find anything interesting. If I can be of service in any way, feel free to contact me by email at [parrisjustin1992@gmail.com]()!

My Current Skillsets Are In: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, MySQL, MongoDB, Node/Express, React, Java, Spring Boot, Bootstrap
